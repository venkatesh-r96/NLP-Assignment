              "'From Trade to Territory                   \\nThe Company Establishes Power2\\nAurangzeb was the last of the powerful Mughal rulers. He \\nestablished control over a very large part of the territory that is now known as India. After his death in 1707, many Mughal governors ( subadars) and big zamindars \\nbegan asserting their authority and establishing regional kingdoms. As powerful regional kingdoms emerged in various parts of India, Delhi could no longer function as an effective centre.\\nBy the second half of the eighteenth century, \\nhowever, a new power was emerging on the political horizon – the British. Did you know that the British originally came as a small trading company and were reluctant to acquire territories? How then did they come to be masters of a vast empire? In this chapter you will see how this came about.\\nFig. 1 – Bahadur Shah Zafar  and his sons being arrested by Captain Hodson\\nAfter Aurangzeb there was no \\npowerful Mughal ruler, but Mughal emperors continued to be symbolically important. In fact, when a massive rebellion against British rule broke out in 1857, Bahadur Shah Zafar, the Mughal emperor at the time, was seen as the natural leader. Once the revolt was put down by the company, Bahadur Shah Zafar was forced to leave the kingdom, and his sons were shot in  cold blood. \\nchap 1-4.indd   9 4/22/2022   2:49:25 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n10 OUR PASTS – IIIEast India Company \\nComes East\\nIn 1600, the East India Company acquired a charter from the ruler of England, Queen Elizabeth I, granting it the sole right to trade with the East. This meant that no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company. With this charter, the Company could venture across the oceans, looking for new lands from which it could buy goods \\nat a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear competition from other English trading companies. Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit primarily by excluding competition, so that they could buy cheap and sell dear.\\nThe royal charter, however, could not prevent other \\nEuropean powers from entering the Eastern markets. By the time the first English ships sailed down the west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India, and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders arrived on the scene. \\nThe problem was that all the companies were \\ninterested in buying the same things. The fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon too were in great demand. Competition amongst the European companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased, and this reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors. The urge to secure markets, therefore, led to fierce battles between the trading companies. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they regularly sank each other’s ships, blockaded routes, and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of \\nFig. 2 –  Routes to India in the eighteenth century\\nMercantile – A business enterprise that makes profit primarily through trade, buying goods cheap and selling them at higher prices\\nchap 1-4.indd   10 4/22/2022   2:49:26 PMRationalised 2023-24\\nFROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         11goods. Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts \\nwere protected through fortification. \\nThis effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable \\ntrade also led to intense conflict with local rulers. The company therefore found it difficult to separate trade from politics. Let us see how this happened. \\nEast India Company begins trade in Bengal\\nThe first English factory was set up on the banks of                  the river Hugli in 1651. This was the base from which the Company’s traders, known at that time as “factors”, operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored, and it had offices where Company officials sat. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. By 1696, it began building a fort around the settlement. Two years later, it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata, which later grew into the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today. It also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting \\nthe Company the right to trade duty free.\\nThe Company tried continuously to press for \\nmore concessions and manipulate existing privileges. Aurangzeb’s farman, for instance, had granted only the \\nCompany the right to trade duty free. But officials of  the Company, who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. This they refused to pay, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal. How could the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan,  \\nnot protest?\\nFig. 3 – Local boats bring goods from ships in Madras, painted by William Simpson, 1867Farman – A royal edict, a royal order\\nchap 1-4.indd   11 4/22/2022   2:49:27 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n12 OUR PASTS – IIIHow trade led to battles\\nThrough the early eighteenth century, the conflict between \\nthe Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified.  After the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy, as other regional powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, demanded large tributes for the Company’s right to trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing to pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to humiliate the nawab and his officials. \\nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust \\ndemands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade, it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and rebuild its forts.    \\nThe conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated \\nin the famous Battle of Plassey.\\nThe Battle of Plassey \\nWhen Alivardi Khan died in 1756, Sirajuddaulah became the nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his power and keen on a puppet ruler who would  willingly \\ngive trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried, though without success, to help one of Sirajuddaulah’s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion, stop fortification, and pay the revenues. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched with 30,000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar, captured the Company officials, locked the warehouse, disarmed all Englishmen, and blockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company’s fort there. \\nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, \\nCompany officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. Finally,  in 1757, Robert Clive led the Company’s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey. One of the main reasons for  \\nDid you know?\\nDid you know how Plassey \\ngot its name? Plassey is an anglicised pronunciation  of Palashi and the place derived its name from the palash  tree known for its \\nbeautiful red flowers that yield gulal , the powder \\nused in the festival of Holi.Fig. 4 – Robert Clive \\nPuppet – Literally, a toy \\nthat you can move with strings. The term is used disapprovingly to refer to a person who is controlled by someone else.\\nchap 1-4.indd   12 4/22/2022   2:49:28 PMRationalised 2023-24\\nFROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         13\\nthe defeat of the Nawab was that the forces led by Mir Jafar, one \\nof Sirajuddaulah’s commanders, never fought the battle. Clive had managed to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah. \\nThe Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major \\nvictory the Company won in India. Fig. 5 – The General Court Room, East India House, Leadenhall Street\\nThe Court of \\nProprietors of the East India Company had their meetings in the East India House on Leadenhall Street in London. This is a picture of one of their meetings in progress.\\nThe promise of riches\\nThe territorial ambitions of the mercantile East India Company were viewed with distrust and doubt in England. After the Battle of Plassey, Robert Clive wrote to William Pitt, one of the Principal Secretaries of State to the English monarch, on 7\\n January 1759 from Calcutta: \\nBut so large a sovereignty may possibly be an object too extensive for a mercantile Company … I flatter myself … that there will be little or no difficulty in obtaining the absolute possession of these rich kingdoms: ... Now I leave you to judge, whether an income yearly of two million sterling with the possession of three provinces … be an object deserving the public attention ...Source 1\\nFig. 6 –  Sirajuddaulah\\nchap 1-4.indd   13 4/22/2022   2:49:30 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n14 OUR PASTS – III\\nAfter the defeat at Plassey, Sirajuddaulah was \\nassassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab. The Company \\nwas still unwilling to take over the responsibility of administration. Its prime objective was the expansion of trade. If this could be done without conquest, through the help of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges, then territories need not be taken over directly. \\nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather \\ndifficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all, they had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and sovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects. \\nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar \\nprotested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir Qasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in turn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1764), driven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The Nawab had to pay Rs. 500,000 every month but the Company wanted more money to finance its wars, and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the time Mir Jafar died in 1765, the mood of the Company had changed. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs, Clive declared: “We must indeed become  \\nnawabs ourselves”.\\nFinally, in 1765 the Mughal emperor appointed the \\nCompany as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth century, its trade with India had expanded. But it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. This was because at this time Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta.  \\nCompany officials become “nabobs”\\nWhat did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that the Company acquired more power and authority. But it also meant something else. Each company servant began to have visions of living like nawabs.Source 2\\nThe Nawab \\ncomplains\\nIn 1733 the Nawab of Bengal said this about the English traders:\\nWhen they first came into the country they petitioned the then government in a humble manner for liberty to purchase a spot of ground to build a factory house upon, which was no sooner granted but they built a strong fort, surrounded it  with a ditch which has communication with the river and mounted a great number of guns upon the walls. They have enticed several merchants and others to go and take protection under them and they collect a revenue which amounts to Rs. 100,000… they rob and plunder and carry great number of the king’s subjects of both sexes into slavery into their own country … \\nchap 1-4.indd   14 4/22/2022   2:49:30 PMRationalised 2023-24\\nFROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         15After the Battle of Plassey, the actual nawabs of \\nBengal were forced to give land and vast sums of \\nmoney as personal gifts to Company officials. Robert Clive himself amassed a fortune in India. He had come to Madras (now Chennai) from England in 1743 at the age of 18. When in 1767 he left India, his Indian fortune was worth £401,102. Interestingly, when he was appointed Governor of Bengal in 1764, he was asked to remove corruption in Company administration but he was himself cross-examined in 1772 by the British Parliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth. Although he was acquitted, he committed suicide  \\nin 1774. \\nHowever, not all Company officials succeeded in \\nmaking money like Clive. Many died an early death in India due to disease and war, and it would not be right to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest. Many of them came from humble backgrounds and their uppermost desire was to earn enough in India, return to Britain and lead a comfortable life. Those who managed to return with wealth led flashy lives and flaunted their riches. They were called  \\n“nabobs” – an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab. They were often seen as upstarts and social climbers in British society and were ridiculed or made fun of in plays and cartoons. \\nCompany Rule Expands\\nIf we analyse the process of annexation of Indian states by the East India Company from 1757 to 1857, certain key aspects emerge. The Company rarely launched a direct military attack on an unknown territory. Instead it used a variety of political, economic and diplomatic methods to extend its influence before annexing an Indian kingdom. \\nAfter the Battle of Buxar (1764), the Company \\nappointed Residents in Indian states. They were political or commercial agents and their job was to serve and further the interests of the Company. Through the Residents, the Company officials began interfering in the internal affairs of Indian states. They tried to decide who was to be the successor to the throne, and who was to be appointed in administrative posts. Sometimes, the Company forced the states into a “subsidiary alliance”. According to the terms of this alliance, Indian rulers were not allowed to have their independent armed forces. They were to be protected by the Company, but \\nHow did Clive \\nsee himself?\\nAt his hearing in front  of a Committee in Parliament, Clive declared that he had shown admirable restraint after the Battle of Plassey. This is what he said:\\nConsider the situation in which the victory at Plassey had placed me! A great prince was dependent on my pleasure; an opulent city lay at my mercy; its richest bankers bid against each other for my smiles; I walked through vaults which were thrown open to me alone, piled on either hand with gold and jewels! Mr Chairman, at this moment I stand astonished at my moderation.Source 3\\nImagine that you are a young Company official  who has been in India for a few months.

Here, however, he poses in regal splendour, towering over the Resident.\\nInjunction – Instruction\\nSubservience – \\nSubmissivenesshad to pay for the “subsidiary forces” that the Company was supposed to maintain for the purpose of this protection. If the Indian rulers failed to make the payment, then part of their territory was taken away as penalty. For example, when Richard Wellesley was Governor-General (1798–1805), the Nawab of Awadh was forced to give over half of his territory to the Company in 1801, as he failed to pay for the “subsidiary forces”. Hyderabad was also forced to cede territories on similar grounds.\\nWhat power did the Resident have?\\nThis is what James Mill, the famous economist and political philosopher from Scotland, wrote about the residents appointed by the Company. \\nWe place a resident, who really is king of the country, whatever injunctions of non-interference he may act under. As long as the prince acts in perfect subservience, and does what is agreeable \\nto the residents, that is, to the British Government, things go on quietly; they are managed without the resident appearing much in the administration of affairs … but when anything of a different nature happens, the moment the prince takes a course which the British Government think wrong, then comes clashing and disturbance.\\nJames Mill (1832)\\nTipu Sultan – The “Tiger of Mysore”\\nThe Company resorted to direct military confrontation when it saw a threat to its political or economic interests. This can be illustrated with the case of the southern Indian state of Mysore.\\nMysore had grown in strength under the leadership \\nof powerful rulers like Haidar Ali (ruled from 1761 to 1782) and his famous son Tipu Sultan (ruled from 1782 to 1799). Mysore controlled the profitable trade of the Malabar coast where the Company purchased pepper and cardamom. In 1785, Tipu Sultan stopped the export of sandalwood, pepper and cardamom through the ports of his kingdom, and disallowed local merchants from trading with the Company. He also established a close \\nFig. 8  – Tipu Sultan\\nchap 1-4.indd   16 4/22/2022   2:49:32 PMRationalised 2023-24\\nFROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         17relationship with the French in India, and modernised \\nhis army with their help. \\nThe British were furious. They saw Haidar and Tipu \\nas ambitious, arrogant and dangerous – rulers who had to be controlled and crushed. Four wars were fought with Mysore (1767–69, 1780–84, 1790–92 and 1799). Only in the last – the Battle of Seringapatam – did the Company ultimately win a victory. Tipu Sultan was killed defending his capital Seringapatam, Mysore was placed under the former ruling dynasty of the Wodeyars and a subsidiary alliance was imposed on the state. \\nFig. 10 – Tipu’s toy tiger \\nThis is the picture of a big mechanical toy that Tipu possessed.  \\nYou can see a tiger mauling a European soldier. When its handle was turned, the toy tiger roared and the soldier shrieked. This  toy-tiger is now kept in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The British took it away when Tipu Sultan died defending his capital Seringapatam on 4 May 1799.Fig. 9 – Cornwallis receiving the sons of Tipu Sultan as hostages, painted by Daniel Orme, 1793\\nThe Company forces were \\ndefeated by Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan in several battles. But in 1792, attacked by the combined forces of the Marathas, the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Company, Tipu was forced to sign a treaty with the British by which two of his sons were  taken away as hostages. British painters always liked painting scenes that showed the triumph of  British power.\\nThe legend of Tipu\\nKings are often surrounded \\nby legend and their powers glorified through folklore. Here is a legend about Tipu Sultan who became the ruler of Mysore in 1782. It is said that once he went hunting in the forest with a French friend. There he came face to face with a tiger. His gun did not work and his dagger fell to the ground. He battled with the tiger unarmed until he  managed to reach down and pick up the dagger. Finally, he was able to kill the tiger in the battle. After this, he came to be known as the “Tiger of Mysore”. He had the image of the tiger on his flag. \\nchap 1-4.indd   17 4/22/2022   2:49:34 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n18 OUR PASTS – IIIWar with the Marathas \\nFrom the late eighteenth century, the Company also \\nsought to curb and eventually destroy Maratha power. With their defeat in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, the Marathas’ dream of ruling from Delhi was shattered. They were divided into many states under different chiefs (sardars) belonging to dynasties such as Sindhia, Holkar, Gaikwad and Bhonsle. These chiefs were held together in a confederacy  under a Peshwa (Principal Minister) \\nwho became its effective military and administrative head based in Pune. Mahadji Sindhia and Nana Phadnis were two famous Maratha soldiers and statesmen of the late eighteenth century. \\nThe Marathas were subdued in a series of wars. \\nIn the first war that ended in 1782 with the Treaty of Salbai, there was no clear victor. The Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803–05) was fought on different fronts, resulting in the British gaining Orissa and the territories north of the Yamuna river including Agra and Delhi. Finally, the Third Anglo-Maratha War of 1817–19 crushed Maratha power. The Peshwa was removed and sent away to Bithur near Kanpur with a pension. The Company now had complete control over the territories south of the Vindhyas. \\nThe claim to paramountcy\\nIt is clear from the above that from the early nineteenth century, the Company pursued an aggressive policy of territorial expansion. Under Lord Hastings (Governor-General from 1813 to 1823), a new policy of “paramountcy” was initiated. Now the Company claimed that its authority was paramount or supreme, hence its power was greater than that of Indian states. In order to protect its interests, it was justified in annexing or threatening to annex any Indian kingdom. This view continued to guide later British policies as well. \\nThis process, however, did not go unchallenged. For \\nexample, when the British tried to annex the small state of Kitoor (in Karnataka today), Rani Channamma took to arms and led an anti-British resistance movement. She was arrested in 1824 and died in prison in 1829. But Rayanna, a poor chowkidar of Sangoli in Kitoor, \\ncarried on the resistance. With popular support, he destroyed many British camps and records. He was caught and hanged by the British in 1830. You will read more about several cases of resistance later in  \\nthe book.Fig. 11 – Lord Hastings. \\n \\nConfederacy – AllianceActivity\\nImagine that you have   come across two old  newspapers reporting on the Battle of Seringapatam and the death of Tipu Sultan.

Driven by this fear, the British now wanted to secure their control over the north-west. They fought a prolonged war with Afghanistan between 1838 and 1842, and established indirect Company rule there. Sind was taken over in 1843. Next in line was Punjab. But the presence of Maharaja Ranjit Singh held back the Company. After his death in 1839, two prolonged wars were fought with the Sikh  kingdom. Ultimately, in 1849, Punjab  \\nwas annexed.\\nThe Doctrine of Lapse\\nThe final wave of annexations occurred under Lord Dalhousie who was the Governor-General from 1848 to 1856. He devised a policy that came to be known as the Doctrine of Lapse. The doctrine declared that if an Indian ruler died without a male heir his kingdom would “lapse”, that is, become a part of Company territory. One kingdom after another was annexed simply by applying this doctrine: Satara (1848), Sambalpur (1850), Udaipur (1852), Nagpur (1853) and  \\nJhansi (1854). \\nFinally, in 1856, the Company also took over Awadh. \\nThis time the British had an added argument – they said they were “obliged by duty” to take over Awadh in order to free the people from the “misgovernment” of the Nawab! Enraged by the humiliating way in which  the Nawab was deposed, the people of Awadh joined the great revolt that broke out in 1857. \\nFig. 13  – Maharaja Ranjit Singh holding court  \\nFig. 14   – A portrait of  Veer \\nSurendra Sai Activity\\nImagine that you are a nawab’s nephew and have been \\nbrought up thinking that you will one day be king.

By his time the Company had acquired power not only                 in Bengal, but also in Bombay and Madras. British territories were broadly divided into administrative units called Presidencies. There were three Presidencies:  Bengal, Madras and Bombay. Each was ruled by a Governor. The supreme head of the administration was the Governor-General. Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General, introduced several administrative reforms, notably in the sphere of justice. \\nFrom 1772 a new system of justice was established. \\nEach district was to have two courts – a criminal court (faujdari adalat ) and a civil court ( diwani adalat ). Maulvis \\nand Hindu pandits interpreted Indian laws for the European district collectors who presided over civil courts. The criminal courts were still under a qazi and a mufti \\nbut under the supervision of the collectors. Qazi – A judge\\nMufti – A jurist of the \\nMuslim community responsible for expounding the law           that the qazi would administer\\nImpeachment – A trial \\nby the House of Lords           in England for charges of misconduct brought against a person in the House of Commons\\nFig. 15 – The trial of Warren Hastings, painted by R.G. Pollard, 1789\\nWhen Warren Hastings went back to England in 1785, Edmund Burke accused him \\nof being personally responsible for the misgovernment of Bengal. This led to an impeachment proceeding in the British Parliament that lasted seven years. \\nchap 1-4.indd   21 4/22/2022   2:49:42 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n22 OUR PASTS – III\\nA major problem was that the Brahman pandits gave \\ndifferent interpretations of local laws based on different \\nschools of the dharmashastra . To bring about uniformity, \\nin 1775 eleven pandits were asked to compile a digest of Hindu laws. N.B. Halhed translated this digest into English. By 1778, a code of Muslim laws was also compiled for the benefit of European judges. Under the Regulating Act of 1773, a new Supreme Court was established, while a court of appeal – the Sadar Nizamat Adalat – was also set up at Calcutta.\\nThe principal figure in an Indian district was the \\nCollector. As the title suggests, his main job was to collect revenue and taxes and maintain law and order in his district with the help of judges, police officers and darogas . \\nHis office – the Collectorate – became the new centre of power and patronage that steadily replaced previous holders of authority.\\nThe Company army\\nColonial rule in India brought in some new ideas of administration and reform but its power rested on its military strength. The Mughal army was mainly composed of cavalry (sawars: trained soldiers on horseback) and infantry, that is, paidal (foot) soldiers. They were given \\ntraining in archery ( teer-andazi ) and the use of the sword. \\nThe cavalry dominated the army and the Mughal state did not feel the need to have a large professionally trained infantry. The rural areas had a large number of armed peasants and the local zamindars often supplied the Mughals with paidal soldiers.\\nA change occurred in the eighteenth century when \\nMughal successor states like Awadh and Benaras started recruiting peasants into their armies and training them as professional soldiers. The East India Company adopted the same method when it began recruitment for its own army, which came to be known as the sepoy army (from the Indian word sipahi, meaning soldier). \\nAs warfare technology changed from the 1820s, the \\ncavalry requirements of the Company’s army declined. This is because the British empire was fighting in Burma, Afghanistan and Egypt where soldiers were armed with muskets and matchlocks. The soldiers of \\nthe Company’s army had to keep pace with changing military requirements and its infantry regiments now became more important. \\nIn the early nineteenth century, the British began  \\nto develop a uniform military culture. Soldiers were Here is a passage from Edmund Burke’s eloquent opening speech during the impeachment of Warren Hastings:\\nI impeach him in the name of the people of India, whose rights he has trodden under his foot and whose country he has turned into a desert. Lastly in the name of human nature itself, in the name of both the sexes, in the name of every age, in the name of every rank, I impeach the common enemy and oppressor of all.Source 5\\n“I impeach the \\ncommon enemy and \\noppressor of all.”\\nDharmashastras – Sanskrit texts prescribing social rules and codes of behaviour, composed from c. 500 \\nBCE onwards\\nSawar – Men on horses\\nMusket – A heavy gun \\nused by infantry soldiers\\nMatchlock – An early \\ntype of gun in which the powder was ignited by a match\\nchap 1-4.indd   22 4/22/2022   2:49:42 PMRationalised 2023-24\\nFROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         23increasingly subjected to European-style training, drill \\nand discipline that regulated their life far more than before. Often this created problems since caste and community feelings were ignored in building a force of professional soldiers. Could individuals so easily give up their caste and religious feelings? Could they see themselves only as soldiers and not as members of communities? \\nWhat did the sepoys feel? How did they react to the \\nchanges in their lives and their identity – that is, their sense of who they were? The Revolt of 1857 gives us a glimpse into the world of the sepoys. You will read about this revolt in Chapter 5.\\nConclusion\\nThus the East India Company was transformed from a trading company to a territorial colonial power. The arrival of new steam technology in the early nineteenth century also aided this process. Till then it would take anywhere between six and eight months to travel to India by sea. Steamships reduced the journey time to three weeks enabling more Britishers and their families to come to a far-off country like India. \\nBy 1857, the Company came to exercise direct rule \\nover about 63 per cent of the territory and 78 per cent of the population of the Indian subcontinent. Combined with its indirect influence on the remaining territory and population of the country, the East India Company had virtually the whole of India under its control.\\nFig. 16 – A sawar of Bengal in the \\nservice of the Company, painted by an unknown Indian artist, 1780\\nAfter the battles with the \\nMarathas and the Mysore rulers, the Company realised the importance of strengthening its cavalry force. \\nchap 1-4.indd   23 4/22/2022   2:49:43 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n24 OUR PASTS – III\\nLet’s recall\\n1.

He \\nestablished control over a very large part of the territory that is now known as India. After his death in 1707, many Mughal governors ( subadars) and big zamindars \\nbegan asserting their authority and establishing regional kingdoms. As powerful regional kingdoms emerged in various parts of India, Delhi could no longer function as an effective centre.\\nBy the second half of the eighteenth century, \\nhowever, a new power was emerging on the political horizon – the British. Did you know that the British originally came as a small trading company and were reluctant to acquire territories? How then did they come to be masters of a vast empire? In this chapter you will see how this came about.\\nFig. 1 – Bahadur Shah Zafar  and his sons being arrested by Captain Hodson\\nAfter Aurangzeb there was no \\npowerful Mughal ruler, but Mughal emperors continued to be symbolically important. In fact, when a massive rebellion against British rule broke out in 1857, Bahadur Shah Zafar, the Mughal emperor at the time, was seen as the natural leader. Once the revolt was put down by the company, Bahadur Shah Zafar was forced to leave the kingdom, and his sons were shot in  cold blood. \\nchap 1-4.indd   9 4/22/2022   2:49:25 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n10 OUR PASTS – IIIEast India Company \\nComes East\\nIn 1600, the East India Company acquired a charter from the ruler of England, Queen Elizabeth I, granting it the sole right to trade with the East. This meant that no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company. With this charter, the Company could venture across the oceans, looking for new lands from which it could buy goods \\nat a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear competition from other English trading companies. Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit primarily by excluding competition, so that they could buy cheap and sell dear.\\nThe royal charter, however, could not prevent other \\nEuropean powers from entering the Eastern markets. By the time the first English ships sailed down the west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India, and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders arrived on the scene. \\nThe problem was that all the companies were \\ninterested in buying the same things. The fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon too were in great demand. Competition amongst the European companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased, and this reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors. The urge to secure markets, therefore, led to fierce battles between the trading companies. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they regularly sank each other’s ships, blockaded routes, and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of \\nFig. 2 –  Routes to India in the eighteenth century\\nMercantile – A business enterprise that makes profit primarily through trade, buying goods cheap and selling them at higher prices\\nchap 1-4.indd   10 4/22/2022   2:49:26 PMRationalised 2023-24\\nFROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         11goods. Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts \\nwere protected through fortification. \\nThis effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable \\ntrade also led to intense conflict with local rulers. The company therefore found it difficult to separate trade from politics. Let us see how this happened. \\nEast India Company begins trade in Bengal\\nThe first English factory was set up on the banks of                  the river Hugli in 1651. This was the base from which the Company’s traders, known at that time as “factors”, operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored, and it had offices where Company officials sat. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. By 1696, it began building a fort around the settlement. Two years later, it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata, which later grew into the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today. It also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting \\nthe Company the right to trade duty free.\\nThe Company tried continuously to press for \\nmore concessions and manipulate existing privileges. Aurangzeb’s farman, for instance, had granted only the \\nCompany the right to trade duty free. But officials of  the Company, who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. This they refused to pay, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal. How could the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan,  \\nnot protest?\\nFig. 3 – Local boats bring goods from ships in Madras, painted by William Simpson, 1867Farman – A royal edict, a royal order\\nchap 1-4.indd   11 4/22/2022   2:49:27 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n12 OUR PASTS – IIIHow trade led to battles\\nThrough the early eighteenth century, the conflict between \\nthe Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified.  After the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy, as other regional powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, demanded large tributes for the Company’s right to trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing to pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to humiliate the nawab and his officials. \\nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust \\ndemands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade, it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and rebuild its forts.    \\nThe conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated \\nin the famous Battle of Plassey.\\nThe Battle of Plassey \\nWhen Alivardi Khan died in 1756, Sirajuddaulah became the nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his power and keen on a puppet ruler who would  willingly \\ngive trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried, though without success, to help one of Sirajuddaulah’s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion, stop fortification, and pay the revenues. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched with 30,000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar, captured the Company officials, locked the warehouse, disarmed all Englishmen, and blockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company’s fort there. \\nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, \\nCompany officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. Finally,  in 1757, Robert Clive led the Company’s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey. One of the main reasons for  \\nDid you know?\\nDid you know how Plassey \\ngot its name?

Clive had managed to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah. \\nThe Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major \\nvictory the Company won in India.

This is a picture of one of their meetings in progress.\\nThe promise of riches\\nThe territorial ambitions of the mercantile East India Company were viewed with distrust and doubt in England. After the Battle of Plassey, Robert Clive wrote to William Pitt, one of the Principal Secretaries of State to the English monarch, on 7\\n January 1759 from Calcutta: \\nBut so large a sovereignty may possibly be an object too extensive for a mercantile Company … I flatter myself … that there will be little or no difficulty in obtaining the absolute possession of these rich kingdoms: ... Now I leave you to judge, whether an income yearly of two million sterling with the possession of three provinces … be an object deserving the public attention ...Source 1\\nFig. 6 –  Sirajuddaulah\\nchap 1-4.indd   13 4/22/2022   2:49:30 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n14 OUR PASTS – III\\nAfter the defeat at Plassey, Sirajuddaulah was \\nassassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab. The Company \\nwas still unwilling to take over the responsibility of administration. Its prime objective was the expansion of trade. If this could be done without conquest, through the help of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges, then territories need not be taken over directly. \\nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather \\ndifficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all, they had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and sovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects. \\nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar \\nprotested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir Qasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in turn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1764), driven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The Nawab had to pay Rs. 500,000 every month but the Company wanted more money to finance its wars, and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the time Mir Jafar died in 1765, the mood of the Company had changed. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs, Clive declared: “We must indeed become  \\nnawabs ourselves”.\\nFinally, in 1765 the Mughal emperor appointed the \\nCompany as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth century, its trade with India had expanded. But it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. This was because at this time Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta.  \\nCompany officials become “nabobs”\\nWhat did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that the Company acquired more power and authority. But it also meant something else. Each company servant began to have visions of living like nawabs.Source 2\\nThe Nawab \\ncomplains\\nIn 1733 the Nawab of Bengal said this about the English traders:\\nWhen they first came into the country they petitioned the then government in a humble manner for liberty to purchase a spot of ground to build a factory house upon, which was no sooner granted but they built a strong fort, surrounded it  with a ditch which has communication with the river and mounted a great number of guns upon the walls. They have enticed several merchants and others to go and take protection under them and they collect a revenue which amounts to Rs. 100',\n",

Robert Clive himself amassed a fortune in India. He had come to Madras (now Chennai) from England in 1743 at the age of 18. When in 1767 he left India, his Indian fortune was worth £401,102. Interestingly, when he was appointed Governor of Bengal in 1764, he was asked to remove corruption in Company administration but he was himself cross-examined in 1772 by the British Parliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth. Although he was acquitted, he committed suicide  \\nin 1774. \\nHowever, not all Company officials succeeded in \\nmaking money like Clive. Many died an early death in India due to disease and war, and it would not be right to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest. Many of them came from humble backgrounds and their uppermost desire was to earn enough in India, return to Britain and lead a comfortable life. Those who managed to return with wealth led flashy lives and flaunted their riches. They were called  \\n“nabobs” – an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab. They were often seen as upstarts and social climbers in British society and were ridiculed or made fun of in plays and cartoons. \\nCompany Rule Expands\\nIf we analyse the process of annexation of Indian states by the East India Company from 1757 to 1857, certain key aspects emerge. The Company rarely launched a direct military attack on an unknown territory. Instead it used a variety of political, economic and diplomatic methods to extend its influence before annexing an Indian kingdom. \\nAfter the Battle of Buxar (1764), the Company \\nappointed Residents in Indian states. They were political or commercial agents and their job was to serve and further the interests of the Company. Through the Residents, the Company officials began interfering in the internal affairs of Indian states. They tried to decide who was to be the successor to the throne, and who was to be appointed in administrative posts. Sometimes, the Company forced the states into a “subsidiary alliance”. According to the terms of this alliance, Indian rulers were not allowed to have their independent armed forces. They were to be protected by the Company, but \\nHow did Clive \\nsee himself?\\nAt his hearing in front  of a Committee in Parliament, Clive declared that he had shown admirable restraint after the Battle of Plassey. This is what he said:\\nConsider the situation in which the victory at Plassey had placed me! A great prince was dependent on my pleasure; an opulent city lay at my mercy; its richest bankers bid against each other for my smiles; I walked through vaults which were thrown open to me alone, piled on either hand with gold and jewels! Mr Chairman, at this moment I stand astonished at my moderation.Source 3\\nImagine that you are a young Company official  who has been in India for a few months.

If the Indian rulers failed to make the payment, then part of their territory was taken away as penalty. For example, when Richard Wellesley was Governor-General (1798–1805), the Nawab of Awadh was forced to give over half of his territory to the Company in 1801, as he failed to pay for the “subsidiary forces”. Hyderabad was also forced to cede territories on similar grounds.\\nWhat power did the Resident have?\\nThis is what James Mill, the famous economist and political philosopher from Scotland, wrote about the residents appointed by the Company. \\nWe place a resident, who really is king of the country, whatever injunctions of non-interference he may act under. As long as the prince acts in perfect subservience, and does what is agreeable \\nto the residents, that is, to the British Government, things go on quietly; they are managed without the resident appearing much in the administration of affairs … but when anything of a different nature happens, the moment the prince takes a course which the British Government think wrong, then comes clashing and disturbance.\\nJames Mill (1832)\\nTipu Sultan – The “Tiger of Mysore”\\nThe Company resorted to direct military confrontation when it saw a threat to its political or economic interests. This can be illustrated with the case of the southern Indian state of Mysore.\\nMysore had grown in strength under the leadership \\nof powerful rulers like Haidar Ali (ruled from 1761 to 1782) and his famous son Tipu Sultan (ruled from 1782 to 1799). Mysore controlled the profitable trade of the Malabar coast where the Company purchased pepper and cardamom. In 1785, Tipu Sultan stopped the export of sandalwood, pepper and cardamom through the ports of his kingdom, and disallowed local merchants from trading with the Company. He also established a close \\nFig. 8  – Tipu Sultan\\nchap 1-4.indd   16 4/22/2022   2:49:32 PMRationalised 2023-24\\nFROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         17relationship with the French in India, and modernised \\nhis army with their help. \\nThe British were furious. They saw Haidar and Tipu \\nas ambitious, arrogant and dangerous – rulers who had to be controlled and crushed. Four wars were fought with Mysore (1767–69, 1780–84, 1790–92 and 1799). Only in the last – the Battle of Seringapatam – did the Company ultimately win a victory. Tipu Sultan was killed defending his capital Seringapatam, Mysore was placed under the former ruling dynasty of the Wodeyars and a subsidiary alliance was imposed on the state. \\nFig. 10 – Tipu’s toy tiger \\nThis is the picture of a big mechanical toy that Tipu possessed.  \\nYou can see a tiger mauling a European soldier. When its handle was turned, the toy tiger roared and the soldier shrieked. This  toy-tiger is now kept in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The British took it away when Tipu Sultan died defending his capital Seringapatam on 4 May 1799.Fig. 9 – Cornwallis receiving the sons of Tipu Sultan as hostages, painted by Daniel Orme, 1793\\nThe Company forces were \\ndefeated by Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan in several battles. But in 1792, attacked by the combined forces of the Marathas, the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Company, Tipu was forced to sign a treaty with the British by which two of his sons were  taken away as hostages. British painters always liked painting scenes that showed the triumph of  British power.\\nThe legend of Tipu\\nKings are often surrounded \\nby legend and their powers glorified through folklore. Here is a legend about Tipu Sultan who became the ruler of Mysore in 1782. It is said that once he went hunting in the forest with a French friend. There he came face to face with a tiger. His gun did not work and his dagger fell to the ground. He battled with the tiger unarmed until he  managed to reach down and pick up the dagger. Finally, he was able to kill the tiger in the battle. After this, he came to be known as the “Tiger of Mysore”. He had the image of the tiger on his flag. \\nchap 1-4.indd   17 4/22/2022   2:49:34 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n18 OUR PASTS – IIIWar with the Marathas \\nFrom the late eighteenth century, the Company also \\nsought to curb and eventually destroy Maratha power. With their defeat in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, the Marathas’ dream of ruling from Delhi was shattered. They were divided into many states under different chiefs (sardars) belonging to dynasties such as Sindhia, Holkar, Gaikwad and Bhonsle. These chiefs were held together in a confederacy  under a Peshwa (Principal Minister) \\nwho became its effective military and administrative head based in Pune. Mahadji Sindhia and Nana Phadnis were two famous Maratha soldiers and statesmen of the late eighteenth century. \\nThe Marathas were subdued in a series of wars. \\nIn the first war that ended in 1782 with the Treaty of Salbai, there was no clear victor. The Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803–05) was fought on different fronts, resulting in the British gaining Orissa and the territories north of the Yamuna river including Agra and Delhi. Finally, the Third Anglo-Maratha War of 1817–19 crushed Maratha power. The Peshwa was removed and sent away to Bithur near Kanpur with a pension. The Company now had complete control over the territories south of the Vindhyas. \\nThe claim to paramountcy\\nIt is clear from the above that from the early nineteenth century, the Company pursued an aggressive policy of territorial expansion. Under Lord Hastings (Governor-General from 1813 to 1823), a new policy of “paramountcy” was initiated. Now the Company claimed that its authority was paramount or supreme, hence its power was greater than that of Indian states. In order to protect its interests, it was justified in annexing or threatening to annex any Indian kingdom. This view continued to guide later British policies as well. \\nThis process, however, did not go unchallenged. For \\nexample, when the British tried to annex the small state of Kitoor (in Karnataka today), Rani Channamma took to arms and led an anti-British resistance movement. She was arrested in 1824 and died in prison in 1829. But Rayanna, a poor chowkidar of Sangoli in Kitoor, \\ncarried on the resistance. With popular support, he destroyed many British camps and records. He was caught and hanged by the British in 1830. You will read more about several cases of resistance later in  \\nthe book.Fig. 11 – Lord Hastings. \\n \\nConfederacy – AllianceActivity\\nImagine that you have   come across two old  newspapers reporting on the Battle of Seringapatam and the death of Tipu Sultan.

Driven by this fear, the British now wanted to secure their control over the north-west. They fought a prolonged war with Afghanistan between 1838 and 1842, and established indirect Company rule there. Sind was taken over in 1843. Next in line was Punjab. But the presence of Maharaja Ranjit Singh held back the Company. After his death in 1839, two prolonged wars were fought with the Sikh  kingdom. Ultimately, in 1849, Punjab  \\nwas annexed.\\nThe Doctrine of Lapse\\nThe final wave of annexations occurred under Lord Dalhousie who was the Governor-General from 1848 to 1856. He devised a policy that came to be known as the Doctrine of Lapse. The doctrine declared that if an Indian ruler died without a male heir his kingdom would “lapse”, that is, become a part of Company territory. One kingdom after another was annexed simply by applying this doctrine: Satara (1848), Sambalpur (1850), Udaipur (1852), Nagpur (1853) and  \\nJhansi (1854). \\nFinally, in 1856, the Company also took over Awadh. \\nThis time the British had an added argument – they said they were “obliged by duty” to take over Awadh in order to free the people from the “misgovernment” of the Nawab! Enraged by the humiliating way in which  the Nawab was deposed, the people of Awadh joined the great revolt that broke out in 1857. \\nFig. 13  –',\n",

By his time the Company had acquired power not only                 in Bengal, but also in Bombay and Madras. British territories were broadly divided into administrative units called Presidencies. There were three Presidencies:  Bengal, Madras and Bombay. Each was ruled by a Governor. The supreme head of the administration was the Governor-General. Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General, introduced several administrative reforms, notably in the sphere of justice. \\nFrom 1772 a new system of justice was established. \\nEach district was to have two courts – a criminal court (faujdari adalat ) and a civil court ( diwani adalat ). Maulvis \\nand Hindu pandits interpreted Indian laws for the European district collectors who presided over civil courts. The criminal courts were still under a qazi and a mufti \\nbut under the supervision of the collectors.

Pollard, 1789\\nWhen Warren Hastings went back to England in 1785, Edmund Burke accused him \\nof being personally responsible for the misgovernment of Bengal. This led to an impeachment proceeding in the British Parliament that lasted seven years. \\nchap 1-4.indd   21 4/22/2022   2:49:42 PMRationalised 2023-24\\n22 OUR PASTS – III\\nA major problem was that the Brahman pandits gave \\ndifferent interpretations of local laws based on different \\nschools of the dharmashastra . To bring about uniformity, \\nin 1775 eleven pandits were asked to compile a digest of Hindu laws. N.B. Halhed translated this digest into English. By 1778, a code of Muslim laws was also compiled for the benefit of European judges. Under the Regulating Act of 1773, a new Supreme Court was established, while a court of appeal – the Sadar Nizamat Adalat – was also set up at Calcutta.\\nThe principal figure in an Indian district was the \\nCollector. As the title suggests, his main job was to collect revenue and taxes and maintain law and order in his district with the help of judges, police officers and darogas . \\nHis office – the Collectorate – became the new centre of power and patronage that steadily replaced previous holders of authority.\\nThe Company army\\nColonial rule in India brought in some new ideas of administration and reform but its power rested on its military strength. The Mughal army was mainly composed of cavalry (sawars: trained soldiers on horseback) and infantry, that is, paidal (foot) soldiers. They were given \\ntraining in archery ( teer-andazi ) and the use of the sword. \\nThe cavalry dominated the army and the Mughal state did not feel the need to have a large professionally trained infantry. The rural areas had a large number of armed peasants and the local zamindars often supplied the Mughals with paidal soldiers.\\nA change occurred in the eighteenth century when \\nMughal successor states like Awadh and Benaras started recruiting peasants into their armies and training them as professional soldiers. The East India Company adopted the same method when it began recruitment for its own army, which came to be known as the sepoy army (from the Indian word sipahi, meaning soldier). \\nAs warfare technology changed from the 1820s, the \\ncavalry requirements of the Company’s army declined. This is because the British empire was fighting in Burma, Afghanistan and Egypt where soldiers were armed with muskets and matchlocks. The soldiers of \\nthe Company’s army had to keep pace with changing military requirements and its infantry regiments now became more important. \\nIn the early nineteenth century, the British began  \\nto develop a uniform military culture. Soldiers were Here is a passage from Edmund Burke’s eloquent opening speech during the impeachment of Warren Hastings:\\nI impeach him in the name of the people of India, whose rights he has trodden under his foot and whose country he has turned into a desert. Lastly in the name of human nature itself, in the name of both the sexes, in the name of every age, in the name of every rank, I impeach the common enemy and oppressor of all.Source 5\\n“I impeach the \\ncommon enemy and \\noppressor of all.”\\nDharmashastras – Sanskrit texts prescribing social rules and codes of behaviour, composed from c. 500 \\nBCE onwards\\nSawar – Men on horses\\nMusket – A heavy gun \\nused by infantry soldiers\\nMatchlock – An early \\ntype of gun in which the powder was ignited by a match\\nchap 1-4.indd   22 4/22/2022   2:49:42 PMRationalised 2023-24\\nFROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         23increasingly subjected to European-style training, drill \\nand discipline that regulated their life far more than before.

The arrival of new steam technology in the early nineteenth century also aided this process. Till then it would take anywhere between six and eight months to travel to India by sea. Steamships reduced the journey time to three weeks enabling more Britishers and their families to come to a far-off country like India. \\nBy 1857, the Company came to exercise direct rule \\nover about 63 per cent of the territory and 78 per cent of the population of the Indian subcontinent.
